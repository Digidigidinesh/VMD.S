🌱 Automated Plant Watering System Project Banner

A simple Streamlit-based application to simulate and manage plant watering automation, with data logging and dataset generation capabilities.

Features 💧 Moisture monitoring with adjustable threshold

⏲️ Configurable watering duration

📊 Data logging using pickle

📈 Dataset generation for analysis

🖥️ Simple web interface with Streamlit

Installation Clone the repository:

Install the required packages: pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib

Usage Running the Streamlit App streamlit run plant_watering_app.py Generating Sample Data Run the generate_dataset.ipynb Jupyter notebook to create sample data in CSV format.

File Structure Copy automated-plant-watering/ ├── plant_watering_app.py # Main Streamlit application ├── generate_dataset.ipynb # Jupyter notebook for dataset generation ├── watering_data.pkl # Data storage file (created after first run) └── plant_watering_dataset.csv # Sample dataset (generated by notebook) Data Model The system stores the following information for each watering event:

timestamp: When the watering occurred

moisture_before: Soil moisture level before watering

duration: How long watering lasted (seconds)

threshold: Moisture threshold setting at time of watering

moisture_after: Soil moisture after watering (in generated dataset)

needed_watering: Whether watering was needed (in generated dataset)
